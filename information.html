                        Education, Intelligence, Defense and Healthcare.
                        But what is its history? Well, if you're interested to know, you have come to the right place.
                        This country did not exist before. We were a part of a nation named Heronia. But there was a disaster. There was
                        a
                        major enemy attack from the nation of Prodania. But after those disasters, some people survived. Those were the
                        people that started this country, Novaria. They are now called "Civil Bloodbath Survivors". They are the
                        original
                        people of this
                        nation.
                
                        Due to the fear of another disaster like that, we focus on Defense and Healthcare. IT, Scientific Advancement,
                        Public Education and Intelligence is also focused on as Heronia was a country that believed a lot in spiritual
                        beings. But some people did not like it. The people who survived "the disaster", were some of those people.
                
                
                        Novarian people always look towards the future, and they want peace and improvement. But if someone does
                        something
                        wrong, the law will not hesitate to give them Capital Punishment and Corporal Punishment. If we are attacked, we
                        WILL defend our country.</th><th style="padding: 10px;"></th>
